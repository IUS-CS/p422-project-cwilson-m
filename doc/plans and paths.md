I plan to create a path that allows me to have the options as buttons such as the atuo, home, and boat that is all going to be buttons.

Once those buttons will be created it will go to a new page and then the new page will have the options to select what type of credit range they have.

one thta is selecteed they will select between a certain amount of money they make or this will be a enter at your own risk type of deal.

then the information about the type of thing you are trying to insure.
for instance: the car will be year, make model, and loan number.
for a boat you will needL year, year, make and model as well.
for home you will need year house was built, loan number, and when you moved in or when you are going to move in.

the final part of this will have a selection to see which agent they want to use.
